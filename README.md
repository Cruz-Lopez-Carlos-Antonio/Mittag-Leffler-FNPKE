# Mittag-Leffler-FNPKE
The present repository contains the MATLAB code that was developed to solve the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetics Equations, using the Laplace transform and the Green Function and which were reported in the paper "Analytical Solution of the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetic Equations using the Mittag-Leffler function", submitted to the journal Computer Physics Communications.

# Analytical solutions of the FNPKE, MATLAB codes
The present repository contains the MATLAB codes that were developed to solve the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetics Equations, using the Laplace transform and the Green Function and which were reported in the paper "Analytical Solution of the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetic Equations using the Mittag-Leffler function", submitted to the journal Computer Physics Communications.

# Mathematical description of the problem
The following fractional differential equation system is solved in the submitted paper:
$$\tau_\alpha D_C^{\alpha+1}\circ\ n\left(t\right)+\frac{dn\left(t\right)}{dt}+\tau_\alpha\left[\frac{P_{NL}\left(1-\rho\right)-1+\beta}{\Lambda}\right]D_C^\alpha\circ n(t)$$
$$=\frac{\rho-\beta}{\Lambda}n\left(t\right)+\tau_\alpha\lambda\ D_C^\alpha\circ\ C\left(t\right)+\lambda\ C\left(t\right),\tag{1}$$
$$\frac{dC\left(t\right)}{dt}=\frac{\beta}{\Lambda}n\left(t\right)-\lambda\ C(t) \tag{2}$$
where: $$\tau_{\alpha}, n(t),\rho, \alpha, P_{NL} \tag{3}$$ are the fractional relaxation time, the neutron density, the reactivity (assummed constant), the fractional order and the nonleakage probability, respectively. And:
 $$C(t), \beta, \Lambda, \lambda \tag{4}$$
